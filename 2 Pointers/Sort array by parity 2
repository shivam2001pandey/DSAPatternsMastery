✅ Sort Array by Parity II – Classification
Category:
👉 Same-direction two pointers (but two independent pointers)
👉 Even-index pointer + odd-index pointer
Why it is Two Pointers?
Because:
One pointer (i) moves on even indices only: 0, 2, 4, ...
One pointer (j) moves on odd indices only: 1, 3, 5, ...
Both move in the same direction, but on separate lanes
Swap when parity doesn’t match the required position
This is a special two-pointer pattern called:
⭐ “Dual-lane Same-direction Two Pointers”''

Multi-lane Pointers (Same direction but independent lanes)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortArrayByParityII(vector<int>& nums) {
        int e=0, o=1;
        while(o<nums.size() && e<nums.size()){
            if(nums[e]%2==0){
                e+=2;
            }
            else if(nums[o]%2!=0){
                o+=2;
            }
            else{
                swap(nums[e],nums[o]);
                e+=2;
                o+=2;
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
};
