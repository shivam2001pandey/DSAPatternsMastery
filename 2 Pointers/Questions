1. OPPOSITE DIRECTION TWO POINTERS (L → ← R)
Use when: array sorted or when shrinking search space, or pair-based logic.
1️⃣ Sort array by parity
Why: Even numbers on left, odd on right ⇒ shrink both sides.
Pointers: l moves forward until odd, r backwards until even → swap.
2️⃣ Partition array by a given pivot
Same logic as quicksort partition.
l moves right until it finds > pivot,
r moves left until it finds < pivot → swap.
3️⃣ 2 Sum (sorted)
Classic opposite direction.
If sum < target → l++
If sum > target → r--
4️⃣ 3 Sum
Outer loop + inside two-pointer (L→R).
Fix i, then find pair using two pointers.
5️⃣ 3 Sum Closest
Same as 3-sum but track minimum difference.
6️⃣ Container With Most Water
Perfect opposite pointer:
Move pointer with smaller height.
7️⃣ Sort Colors (Dutch flag) – partial
Actually a variant of 3-way partition, but uses 3 pointers (l, mid, r).
This is multi-pointer, not strict opposite-direction, but still pointer-based.
8️⃣ Lexicographically smallest palindrome (string)
Two pointers inward → replace mismatching characters with smaller one.
9️⃣ Reverse words in a string
Two pointers to reverse characters inside each word.
1️⃣0️⃣ Sentence similarity III
Two pointers compare beginning and end words of sentence1 and sentence2.

All above use:
Shrink inward. Compare elements. Move either left or right depending on condition.

2. SAME-DIRECTION TWO POINTERS (FAST–SLOW)
Use when:
removing/keeping filtered elements
overwriting
compressing
scanning forward without shrinking window
1️⃣ Remove duplicates from sorted array
Fast scans entire array.
Slow marks valid position.
If new element appears → copy to slow.
2️⃣ Rotate array
If using reversal technique: not two pointers.
But if rotating using in-place swapping cycles → not two pointers.
✔️ Best classification: NOT a two pointer problem. (see below)
3️⃣ Next permutation
Not two pointers in strict sense, but uses pointer scan (from right) to find first descending pair, then swap with next larger, then reverse suffix using two pointers.
→ last step uses two pointers to reverse.
4️⃣ Find all K-distant indices in array
This is NOT actually two pointers.
This is prefix-min or scanning logic.
No pointer relationship is needed.
✔️ These use:
One pointer reads, the other writes.

Sort array by parity 2
sort colors
partition array by given pivot
